        <p class="paragraph">
          Trase is a powerful new sustainability platform that enables governments, companies, investors
          and others to better understand and address the environmental and social impacts linked to
          their supply chains.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Its pioneering approach draws on vast sets of production, trade and customs data, for the first
          time laying bare the flows of globally traded commodities from production landscapes to
          consumer countries for entire countries and commodity sectors. Along the way it identifies the
          ports of export and import, and the producers, traders and transporters involved. These supply
          chain actors can then be linked back to environmental and social risk factors on the ground, as
          well as information on the social and governance factors necessary to improve conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Trase focuses on the handful of commodities – including soy, beef, palm oil and timber – that
          drive two-thirds of deforestation globally. It comes as a direct response to the ambitious
          commitments made by leaders across sectors to achieve deforestation-free supply chains by
          2020 – and the urgent need this creates for a breakthrough in assessing and monitoring
          sustainability performance.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Over the next five years, Trase aims to map the trade and risks for over 70% of total production
          in major forest risk commodities, catalysing a transformation in supply chain sustainability for
          the agricultural drivers of deforestation. Read

        <h2 id="who-is-for" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">Who is Trase for?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Trase is an open-access platform. In revealing the sustainability risks and opportunities that
          connect production landscapes with consumers worldwide, the platform can help actors at every
          stage of the supply chain make smarter decisions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="paragraph">
            Commodity traders striving to meet sustainability commitments and to de-risk their
            supply chains. The platform provides the data and tools to monitor company progress,
            demonstrate their sustainability credentials to consumers and business partners, identify
            other actors along their supply chains to cooperate with, and plan more sustainable
            sourcing strategies.
          </li>
          <li class="paragraph">
            Producer country governments who want to promote sustainable production, reduce
            poverty, build effective partnerships with companies down the supply chain, and monitor
            the activities of producers and exporters across different jurisdictions.
          </li>
          <li class="paragraph">
            Consumer country governments who want to understand and manage their countries’
            socio-environmental impacts abroad, make sustainable procurement decisions and meet
            commitments such as the EU’s Amsterdam Declarations on sustainable palm oil.
          </li>
          <li class="paragraph">
            Civil society organizations and multi-stakeholder processes committed to providing
            independent monitoring and assessment of private- and public-sector actors involved in
            the trade of globally significant commodities, including those that have made individual
            or collective commitments such as under the New York Declaration on Forests.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In addition, in the longer term, Trase aims to provide specific decision support to stakeholders.
          For example: investors who want to de-risk their portfolios, manufacturers and retailers as well
          as consumer groups committed to more sustainable consumption, and journalists and
          campaigning groups who play a vital watchdog role in strengthening the accountability of global
          supply chains.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-it-work" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">How does it work?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Trase’s supply chain mapping relies on the triangulation of several key sources of data. To trace
          exports back to production landscapes it uses sub-national production data from national
          governments, publicly available data on the supply chain logistics of companies, as well as
          data on the subnational origin of shipped goods gathered at port level. The mapping of global
          trade flows relies chiefly on customs declarations and bills of lading, which are based on legal
          contracts between trading partners, and on official global trade data (e.g. from the UN Food and
          Agricultural Organization) to account for re-exports between countries.
