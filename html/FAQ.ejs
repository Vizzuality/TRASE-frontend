        <h2 id="what-is-trase" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">What is Trase?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Trase is a powerful new sustainability platform that enables
          governments, companies, investors and others to better understand
          and address the environmental and social impacts linked to their
          supply chains.
        </p>

        <h2 id="trase-platform-do" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">What does the Trase platform do?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Trase maps exports of forest-risk commodities from the jurisdictions
          (usually subnational, such as municipalities) where they were produced
          to the countries that import them, showing different stages and actors
          along the supply chain. It links these flows to social and
          environmental data, including on deforestation, to identify
          associated sustainability risks, as well as opportunities for
          responsible production and sourcing. One of the main innovations of
          Trase is the fact that we map this central portion of global commodity
          supply chains - from jurisdictions of production to countries of
          import - for the entire exports of a given commodity.
        </p>

        <h2 id="commodity-supply-chains" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">What commodity supply chains does Trase cover?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Currently, Trase maps soy exports from Brazil and Parguay, traceable
          to the level of producer municipalities, as well as Argentinian soy
          and cattle exports from those three countries, traceable to national
          ports. Starting in 2017, Trase will start to expand to other major
          commodities including Indonesian palm oil and timber. By 2021 we aim
          to cover 70% of the global trade in the forest risk commodities of
          soy, cattle, timber, pulp and paper, and palm oil. In future years
          we hope to be able to cover domestic consumption of commodities as
          well as exports.
        </p>

        <h2 id="trase-indicators" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">What indicator data does Trase show?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Trase currently focuses on supply chains of agricultural commodities
          associated with deforestation and other related impacts, including
          on water, biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions and rural development
          and livelihoods. Trase also includes data on the economic value of
          exports, and we will soon be including indicators of good agricultural
          management practices and good territorial governance. We are only at
          the beginning of exploring the range of environmental, social and
          economic indicators that can be linked to Trase. See Data and Methods
          for more information on the indicators that are currently available.
        </p>

        <h2 id="which-companies-countries" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">Can Trase tell me which companies and countries are directly responsible for deforestation?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          No. Trase assesses a supply chain actor’s exposure to the reputational,
          legal, operational and other risks associated with deforestation.
          These risks are linked to the amount of deforestation that took place
          in the jurisdictions (e.g. municipalities) where a forest-risk commodity
          handled by the actor was produced, during a given period. Read the
          blog “Assessing deforestation risks facing supply chain actors” for
          more information on how Trase measures and assesses risk.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Without information on the location of individual source farms Trase
          cannot provide a definitive assessment of the deforestation or other
          impacts that are associated with a given company. However, Trase
          provides a powerful first step in helping to filter and identify the
          extent to which that deforestation is likely to be linked to a given
          commodity, and help inform critical sourcing decisions, as well as
          guide the investments and monitoring protocols that are needed to
          make production practices more sustainable.
        </p>

        <h2 id="deforestation-free" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">Can Trase tell me what consumer goods are deforestation-free?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Currently Trase only maps export commodity supply chains to the first
          country of import. From there, the commodity may undergo several
          further steps of processing, sales and exports before it reaches the
          consumer market in its final form. Therefore further research is
          needed to link the commodity flows in Trase to specific consumer goods.
        </p>

        <h2 id="trase-work" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">How does the supply chain mapping in the Trase platform work?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Trase platform is based on the Spatially Explicit Information
          of Production to Consumption Systems (SEI-PCS) approach to mapping
          commodity supply chains. SEI-PCS processes publically available tax,
          logistics customs and shipping data, making it possible to trace
          material flows from the municipality of origin, through traders and
          exporters, to the country of consumption. SEI-PCS was developed by
          SEI – for more information see the Data and Methods section.
        </p>

        <h2 id="diagram-tangled" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">What is that diagram that looks like strands of spaghetti?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Trase platform represents flows of commodities using Sankey
          diagrams. Invented by an Irish ship’s captain, Matthew Sankey, Sankey
          diagrams have been in use for over 100 years. We use Sankey diagrams
          in Trase because they can show not only the direction but also the
          scale of flows between points in the supply chain in an intuitive way.
          The interactive Sankeys on the Trase platform were developed by
          researchers at the Stockholm Environment Institute in partnership
          with Vizzuality. They allow users to customize the Sankey diagram to
          show material flows according to a particular node or set of nodes in
          the chain, or particular characteristics of the material flow.

        <h2 id="trase-reliability" class="title -anchor -medium -pink">How reliable is the Trase data?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Trase approach to supply chain mapping uses data from dozens of
          different sources including official government data on production,
          tax, and shipping, as well as other datasets on supply chain logistics
          freely disclosed by industry associations and on the websites of
          commodity trading companies. The combination of multiple datasets is
          key to ensuring the integrity of our approach. Trase is dedicated to
          clearly communicating the limitations of the data within our
          methodologies and in the tool itself. We encourage users to visit
          our disclaimer, terms of use, and methodology documents to fully
          understand the strength of Trase data and limitations to its use.
